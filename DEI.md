## Scope of the DEI.md File

Our project prioritizes and reflects on DEI through a regular review of project policies and performance. This reflection is documented in the following DEI.md file based on specific [CHAOSS project](https://chaoss.community) DEI metrics.

### [Project Access](https://chaoss.community/?p=4953)

Project access is addressed in our project through various efforts. Through these efforts, we aim to support access for all. Specific efforts in our project include:

* **Open Source Availability**: Torch Hammer is freely available under the Apache 2.0 license, ensuring anyone can use, modify, and distribute the software without cost barriers.
* **Cross-Platform Support**: We support multiple hardware platforms (NVIDIA CUDA, AMD ROCm, Apple Metal, CPU) to ensure accessibility regardless of hardware availability.
* **Comprehensive Documentation**: Our README provides detailed installation instructions for various platforms and skill levels.
* **Multiple Installation Methods**: We offer pip install, manual install, and development install options to accommodate different user preferences and technical backgrounds.
* **Minimal Dependencies**: The single-file design (`torch-hammer.py`) allows direct execution without complex setup, lowering the barrier to entry.

### [Communication Transparency](https://chaoss.community/?p=4957)

Communication Transparency is addressed in our project through a variety of different efforts. Through these efforts, we aim to support transparency for all. Specific efforts in our project include:

* **Public Issue Tracker**: All bugs, feature requests, and discussions are tracked publicly on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/HPE/torch-hammer/issues).
* **Open Development**: All code changes are made through public pull requests with visible review processes.
* **Clear Contribution Guidelines**: Our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) clearly documents how decisions are made and how contributions are reviewed.
* **Transparent Governance**: Project governance and maintainer information is documented in the README.
